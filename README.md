# Herfi

Herfi is a 3D multiplayer game prototype/technical demo written in Clojure and ClojureScript. 

Big thanks to **infinitelives/px3d** and **PlayCanvas** projects, I couldn't have managed to build this project without them. This project is a fork of **px3d**, and I tried to mimic the ECS (Entity Component System) of PlayCanvas.
